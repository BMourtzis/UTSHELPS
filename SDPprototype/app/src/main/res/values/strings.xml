        We offer 15-minute drop-on advice sessions and 40-minute one-to-one consultations by referral to help you with your assignment writing and preparation.
        Drop-in consultations are held at:

        At the initial stage of your assignment writing or preparation process, you are strongly encouraged to come and see HELPS. The best time to see us is when you first receive your assignment.
        HELPS Advisors can help edit your assignment WITH you, not FOR you - helping you to edit for:
        Structure and argument – that your writing is logically organised with well-developed and well-supported arguments.
        Style and expression – that your choice of vocabulary is appropriate, sentences are well constructed, ideas are clearly introduced, and paragraphs are fully developed.
        Grammar – that your issues are identified and explained so you can learn from your mistakes and avoid making them in the future.
        Proof reading is the final step in the editing process, with the aim of producing an error-free assignment. It is your responsibility to check for mistakes in spelling, punctuation, typing and formatting in your assignment before you submit it to your lecturer.
